## Token
The FTX Token is used to power the FintruX Network and works as a means to reward or get rewarded for participation in the marketplace. Each activity on the platform has an associated cost specified in FTX (“or ꭍ”). In particular, if FTX goes up in value, the insurance provided by the over and cross-collateralization pools will cover potential credit/default losses. 

FTX is transferred from one participant to another as activities are carried out on the FintruX Network. FintruX Network will be rewarded a fee subsequent to executing these activities.

Ownership of FTX Token carries no rights other than the right to exchange and claim over the platform. FTX does not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation relating to the FintruX Network.

Our FTX Tokens serve several key functions in our ecosystem:
- Credit enhancement reserve
- Transaction execution reward
- Rewards for good behavior
- Punishment for bad behavior
- Reward for providing information
- Platform access
- API license

Any tokens not sold in the crowdsale will be burned. This introduces a predictable and effective reward structure for using FTX. The remainder is reinvested in the operation and growth of the platform.

## Bonus Tiers
There are five (5) bonus tiers for the token sale. The distribution of each tier is based on a first-come-first-serve basis. Any cross-over on multiple tiers will be split accordingly. Early purchase will benefit from the highest bonus, which will diminish down to 0% bonus at the last tier.
