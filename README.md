## Token

The FTX Token is used to power the FintruX platform and works as a mean to reward or get rewarded for participation in the marketplace. Each activity on the platform has an associated cost specified in FTX (“or ꭍ”). As activities are carried out on the platform, FTX is transferred from one participant to another. As a result of executing these activities, the platform will be rewarded a fee.
The tokens serve several functions in our environment:
- Transaction execution reward
- Reward for providing information
- Platform access
- API license

## Presale

A presale is scheduled to last two weeks from the 11th of October 5:00 pm UTC to the 25th of the same month at 5:00 pm UTC. 
FTX will be sold at a bonus of 40% to start. Each ETH can be exchanged for 700 FTX. In the event the soft cap of 7,000,000 FTX (7% of total supply) is reached, the sale will end 48 hours after. Users can contribute past the soft cap at the rate of 1 ETH : 650 FTX until the closing of the presale or the hard cap of 75,000,000 FTX (75% of total supply) is reached, whichever is earlier.

## Crowdsale

FTX will be issued during our crowdsale. Once completed, no further tokens will be generated. The sale will last three weeks from the 8th of November 5:00 pm UTC to the 29th of the same month at 5:00 pm UTC.
A maximum of 100,000,000 FTX tokens will be generated, of those 25,000,000 tokens will be kept as reserve.
A maximum of 75,000,000 FTX will be sold during the crowdsale, any remaining tokens will be burned.

## Bonus Tiers

There are five (5) bonus tiers for the crowdsale. The price for each tier is calculated on a bonus model and the distribution of the tiers is based on a first-come-first-serve basis. Early investment will benefit from the highest bonus, which will diminish down to 0% bonus at the last tier.
The team has pre-determined a minimum goal of 10,000 ETH that represents the runway necessary for the core FintruX platform to be finished and released with minimum functionality. If the minimum goal is not reached by the end of the crowdsale duration, all contributed Ether will be marked for refund. Anyone who contributed, including those who purchased our tokens at presale, will be able to withdraw their Ether from the sale contract.
